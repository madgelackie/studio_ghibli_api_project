Overview
----

This was a weekend project to explore accessing and using data from an API.

The page initially populates with each of the films from the API with a small image.  Click on a film title to view further details - this component uses a combination of two endpoints.
User can select films to add to their watch list.  
Once seen, the user can add the film to their seen list which also automatically remove it from the watch list. 

API source: <https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/>

Built using ⚛️ React.

To open:

In the terminal, whilst in the project directory run:

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser.
