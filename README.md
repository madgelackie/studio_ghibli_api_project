This was a weekend project to explore accessing and using data from an API.

USAGE
-----
The page initially populates with each of the films from the API.  Click on a film title to view further details - this involved combining two endpoints.
User can select films to add to their watch list.  Once seen, the user can add the film to their seen list which also automatically remove it from the watch list. 

API source: <https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/>

Built using ⚛️React.
